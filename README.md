# Queueing theory
Queueing theory is the mathematical study of waiting lines or queues.
We use queueing theory in our software development to analyze and optimize our practices and processes, such as our customer service responsiveness, project management kanban planning, inter-process communication message queues, and DevOps continuous deployment pipelines.

## Introduction
We use queueing theory in our projects for many purposes:
<h5>1- Customer service responsiveness</h5>
<h5>2- Project management kanban planning</h5>
<h5>3- Inter-process communication message queues</h5>
<h5>4- DevOps continuous deployment pipelines</h5>

## Queue types and service types
Queue types and service types describe how the queue chooses which items to process.
<h5>1- First In First Out (FIFO): serve the customer who has been waiting for the longest time.</h5>
<h5>2- Last In First Out (LIFO): serve the customer who has been waiting for the shortest time.</h5>
<h5>3- Priority: serve customers based on their priority level; these levels could be based on status, urgency, payment, etc.</h5>
<h5>4- Shortest Job First (SJF): serve the customer who needs the smallest amount of service.</h5>
<h5>5- Longest Job First (LJF): serve the customer who needs the largest amount of service.</h5>
<h6>6- Time Sharing: serve everyone at the same time; service capacity is distributed evenly among everyone waiting.</h6>
